# Yann - Yet Another Neural Network Library

## Purpose

- Reimplement material from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in F# to gain deeper understanding.
- Build a .NET Core DNN library for other projects.

## Features

- Uses [Math.NET Numerics](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/) [~33% slower than numpy implementation for Cats vs non-Cats Week 4 example on ThinkPad X1 Extreme]
- Customizable L-layer FC DNN Library (Unit tested + Demo apps)
- Activation: ReLU, Sigmoid
- Hyperparameters: L, Î±, Epochs
- Initialization: He
- Basic transfer learning
